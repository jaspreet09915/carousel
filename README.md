# Carousel
This is a React carousel that works using touch, keyboard, and swipes.
This is a work in progress and it will be updated with time.


# Installation
This package can be installed in your project using ```npm install judabne-react-carousel```.
In case you are using CSS modules in react (v16.8+ - if you haven't manually set the css-loader - e.g you used ```create-react-app```)
you can proceed by renaming the Carousel.css file to Carousel.module.css (do not forget to change the import in Carousel.js to "Carousel.module.css" as well).

You can also add the component manually to your react project by downloading the ```carousel/src/components/Carousel/``` from this repository.
You get access to the code and you can modify it accordingly.

This repository also includes a working example, similar to https://judabne-react-carousel.web.app/
